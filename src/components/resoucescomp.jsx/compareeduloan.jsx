        <h2>Why compare education loan?</h2>
        <p>
          With the ever-increasing cost of education more and more students are
          opting for student loans to finance their education expenses. To meet
          this requirement, banks and NBFCs are stepping in to provide loans at
          highly competitive interest rates. Students have a plethora of options
          to choose from based on their requirement (loan amount, secured or
          unsecured loan, etc). It is important for students to thoroughly
          understand the various factors on which loans can be compared and keep
          them in consideration to select the right bank. Following are some
          factors based on which, an applicant can compare education loans: ●
          INTEREST RATE: While comparing education loans, the borrower should
          consider the rate of interest, the bank is offering. Lower the
          interest rate better is the loan offer. ● LOAN AMOUNT: A borrower must
          consider the loan amount that the bank is ready to offer. If the loan
          amount that the bank is offering, is less than what the borrower
          needs, then the borrower should consider loans offered by other banks.
          ● REPAYMENT PERIOD: The repayment period effects EMI, and thus, the
          borrower should choose the repayment period he/she is getting,
          corresponding to the EMI that he wants to pay after his/her course. ●
          MORATORIUM PERIOD: Some banks offer a moratorium period ranging from 6
          months to 1 year, whereas some of them may not even offer one. The
          borrower should consider all these factors to choose the best offer
          for him/ her.

          Different banks have different criteria for fixing the interest rates
          on loans; borrower’s academic performance, college, family background,
          collateral provided, etc are factors on which the interest rate can be
          negotiated. ● APPLY TO DIFFERENT BANKS. Education loans can be availed
          from various banks and can be compared by applying to multiple banks.
          While comparing different banks can help in getting the best offer on
          education loans, the entire process of applying to banks can get
          tedious and cumbersome. ● ONLINE COMPARISON. Student can use Feefi as
