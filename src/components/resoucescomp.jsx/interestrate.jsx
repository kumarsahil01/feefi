            The rate of interest on education loan is an important factor that
            helps students to choose the right bank. For domestic cases,the
            average interest rate is 11% while it is 12.5% for foreign
            universities. The rate of interest for each case also depends upon
            the student’s academic profile, co-applicant’s financial condition,
            and various other factors.

          Interest rates on education loan are different for each bank and
          applicant. A number of factors affect the rate of interests such as
          the following:
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>ACADEMIC RECORD:</b>The applicant’s academic record plays a
          significant role in deciding the rate of interests on education loan.
          If the applicant has been able to maintain a continuous track record
          of First Class, then he/she is likely to get an education loan at a
          lower interest rate. Similarly, if the applicant has an average or
          below average academic record, the bank may charge high interest rate
          on education loan.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>CO-BORROWER’S CREDIT SCORE:</b>The applicant’s academic record
          plays a significant role in deciding the rate of interests on
          education loan. If the applicant has been able to maintain a
          continuous track record of First Class, then he/she is likely to get
          an education loan at a lower interest rate. Similarly, if the
          applicant has an average or below average academic record, the bank
          may charge high interest rate on education loan.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>COLLATERAL PROVIDED:</b>The applications in which the applicant can
          provide collateral, usually get education loans sanctioned at low
          interest rates. In general, unsecured loans have higher rate of
          interests as compared to secured loans.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>CCOLLEGE/INSTITUTE:</b>TThe College in which the applicant is
          getting admission is a major deciding factor of interest rates. If the
          college has good campus placements, any bank would be ready to
          disburse loans at low interest rates.

          Education loan interest rate in India
        </h1>

        <p>
          <b>BASE RATE::</b>Base rate is the minimum lending rate set by RBI,
          below which no bank is permitted to charge interest rates.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>FLOATING RATE:</b>It is the total interest rate which changes with
          the market fluctuations. Floating rate of interest consists of a
          variable index. Variable index is controlled by RBI, so when the RBI
          changes the variable index, the ROI on the educational loan also
          changes.

        <h3 className="mt-2 text-xl">Section 80 E- Income tax benefit</h3>
        <p>
          According to Section 80E of Income Tax Act of India, 1961, the
          interest amount paid on the education loan by the borrower can be
          claimed as deduction. The maximum exemption that a person can claim on
          the tax is equal to the interest he pays on his education loan. The
          exemption on tax can be claimed maximum for 8 years or till when the
          interest is paid on education loan, whichever is earlier. However, the
          principal part does not qualify for any tax benefit.
